# project-of-the-week
Weekly coding projects from my coding blog will be posted here.
## How to run a project
1. Go to the Actions tab.
2. On the left-hand side of the page, click on the project of your choice, excluding Python CI (this file is used to handle Python edits).
3. Click on the "Run workflow" dropdown, then click on the "Run workflow" button. Some projects allow you to change arguments before running the workflow. The workflow should take around 5-10 seconds before it is finished running.
4. Click on the most recent workflow, located at the top of the workflow runs section. It should have the same name as the project.
5. Click on the "run" button (it should have a green check mark to the left).
6. To view the program, click on the "Run script" dropdown.
## How to view the project code
1. Go to the Code tab.
2. Go to the folder of the year in which the project was created.
3. Choose the correct programming language for the file. Currently, this repository only contains Python projects; however, more coding languages will be added in the future.
4. Click on the project of your choice.
